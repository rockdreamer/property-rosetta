- id: atom.chemical_diagram_index
  name: Index of the chemical diagram this atom belongs to
  type: int32
  description: |
    An index identifying which chemical diagram in a crystal this atom belongs to

    Note: the fact that this entry exists does not mean that it has to be serialised and encoded everywhere
    However, where it makes sense, implementations can use it as a consistent method of identifying
    where the atom belongs
# Descriptive properties
- id: atom.element
  name: Element Type
  type: elementid
  description: the element of the atom
- id: atom.isotope
  name: Isotope
  type: int32 # TODO: should this be an enum?
  description: |
    Used to indicate whether the atom is the main or another isotope.

    Historically, the CSD mostly contains main isotopes, Deuterium being the exception to this rule.
